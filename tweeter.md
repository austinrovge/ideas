# tweeter

Originally when I took se4910 (Mobile Application Development - Android), I planned for my final project to be tweeter - an android app that used the twitter API to be another twitter client. Senioritis/work/senior design hit me hard and I did minimal work for it.

### Scope

I vaguely remember reading twitter's API docs and being a bit confused at navigating it. I'm lazy and don't feel like rereading it or applying for another dev account, so the scope could be expanded to include a simple API/DB to act as a simpler twitter. That would be nice for being able to do some cloud things since I haven't had too many good side project ideas in that domain.  

### Technologies

* Kotlin
* Jetpack compose
* Dagger
* AWS SNS/firebase (push notificaitons)
* AWS ECS fargate (API)
* Terraform
